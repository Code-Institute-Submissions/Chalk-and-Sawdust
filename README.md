# Deployment and Demo

Website has been deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://joshhunt1991.github.io/Chalk-and-Sawdust/).

# Wireframe

The wireframe was designed using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) and links to the final version can be found below:

- [Wireframe Final Version](/readmelinks/CHALK-AND-SAWDUST.bmpr)

# UX

I have opted for a responsive design which is quite image heavy and has a loading time of 3.1 seconds.

- Home page: Contains a jumbotron, background image, and an automatic image slider which all resize accordingly depending on user's viewport size
- The big 3 page: Contains and introduction to the concept of powerlifting and 3 responsive videos with accompanying text 
- About page: Contains a paragraph explaining the gym ethos and 3 responsive images demonstrating the benefits of the gym.
- Contact page: Contains a responsive contact form, responsive embedded google map and another image slider
- Membership page: Contains opening times, information on membership packages, a button linking to a modal containing the membership form and another image slider.

In order to improve user experience and website loading speed I resized some of my images to closer to their actual size on the site which improved loading time from 2.4 seconds to 1.4 seconds.

# Visual Identity

- [Canva](https://www.logopony.com/) for the logo design and then the color scheme was extended from this to the rest of the site

The points below can be improved with a bit more optimization:

- Image optimization
- Leveraging browser caching

I tested the modal form to make sure that it opens and submits to the code institute form dump. images below.

# Scalability

I'd like to have an intergrated web chat application on the website that allows users to talk directly in real time to a personal trainer to do online assessments before setting foot in the gym.
